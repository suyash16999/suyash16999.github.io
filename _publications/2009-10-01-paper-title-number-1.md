title: "Digital Twins for Maintaining QoS in Programmable Vehicular Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is a vision for future V2X networks equipped with programmable base stations and Reconfigurble Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to mitigate the frequent blockages in dynamic vehicular networks. In our method, a LiDAR sensor mounted autonomous car detects obstacles between itself and the base station (BS) it is connected to during its voyage in order to predict NLOS situations, which are then reported to the BS, where the digital twin is deployed.
