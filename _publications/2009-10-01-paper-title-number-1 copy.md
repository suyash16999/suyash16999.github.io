title: "COPILOT: Cooperative Perception using Lidar for Handoffs between Road Side Units"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper presents COPILOT, a ML-based approach that allows vehicles requiring ubiquitous high bandwidth connectivity to identify the most suitable road side units (RSUs) through proactive handoffs. By cooperatively exchanging the data obtained from local 3D Lidar point clouds within adjacent vehicles and with coarse knowledge of their relative positions, COPILOT identifies transient blockages to all candidate RSUs along the path under study. Such cooperative perception is critical for choosing RSUs with highly directional links required for mmWave bands, which majorly degrade in the absence of LOS. COPILOT proposes three modules that operate in an inter-connected manner: (i) As an alternative to sending raw Lidar point clouds, it extracts and transmits low-dimensional intermediate features to lower the overhead of inter-vehicle messaging; (ii) It utilizes an attention-mechanism to place greater emphasis on data collected from specific vehicles, as opposed to nearest neighbor and distance-based selection schemes, and (iii) it experimentally validates the outcomes using an outdoor testbed composed of an autonomous car and Talon AD7200 60GHz routers emulating the RSUs, accompanied by the public release of the datasets. Results reveal COPILOT yields upto 69.8% and 20.42% improvement in latency and throughput compared to traditional reactive handoffs for mmWave networks, respectively.'
